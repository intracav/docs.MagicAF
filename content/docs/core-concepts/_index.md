MagicAF is built around a small number of powerful ideas designed for **defense-grade, HIPAA-compliant, secure environments**. Understanding these concepts will help you use the framework effectively and extend it for your domain — whether that's **SIPR/NIPR classified systems**, **secret government infrastructure**, **defense applications**, or **HIPAA-regulated healthcare environments**. MagicAF goes beyond LLMs to provide comprehensive NLP, RAG, and AI analysis capabilities.
