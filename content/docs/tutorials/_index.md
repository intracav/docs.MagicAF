Tutorials are **guided, narrative walkthroughs** — distinct from [Guides](/docs/guides/) (how-to references) and [Examples](/docs/examples/) (annotated code). Each tutorial explains *why* you're doing each step, not just *what* to type.

**Follow them in order** — each builds on the previous one.

## How Tutorials Differ from Guides and Examples

| | Tutorials | Guides | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Teach a concept through a project | Show how to accomplish a task | Provide runnable reference code |
| **Narrative** | Story-driven, explains "why" | Step-by-step, explains "how" | Annotated code with key points |
| **Order** | Sequential — follow in order | Independent — pick what you need | Independent — pick your level |
| **Audience** | Learning MagicAF | Using MagicAF | Referencing MagicAF |
